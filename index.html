<p>I find value in helping solve problems.</p>
<p> I write prototype & research code, manage teams, and occasionally write/talk.</p>

<p>At present, I manage the hand tracking team 👋 at <a href="https://www.ultraleap.com/">Ultraleap</a> and am co-founding a decentralized media organization 🌌 <a href="http://channel.xyz">channel</a>.</p>
